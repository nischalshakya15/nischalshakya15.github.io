</div>![](index_files/figure-html/No of school having 100 percent pass result-1.png)<!-- -->

Here, we can see Rasuwa was only a district without 100 percent pass result. Hence, we can assume that there is lack of quality education in Rasuwa district.

## General summary of 100% pass result {.tabset .tabset-fade}
Despite of 100% pass result, it seems in some school there is zero distiction. 
So, this seciton will summarize the total no of student on basics of grade having zero distinction within 100% pass result and vice versa.

### Having Distinction

From above table, we can conclude that school having 100% pass rate with distinction the no of student acheiving the third division is Zero. Hence, we can remove the column third division while visualizing data.

<p class="caption">Fig 4:- Total No of Student in each district on basics of grade</p>
</div>
From above barchart, we can conclude that Kathmandu district had the maximum pass rate in comparision to another district. So we can assume that another district lacks the proper educational facilities as well as school.

</div>
Since, we are filtering school without having distinction. It will be obvious that there will be zero distinction. So, we can remove distinction while visualizing data.
<div class="figure" style="text-align: c">

</div>
From above barchart, we can conclude that Kathmandu district had the maximum pass rate in comparision to another district. So we can assume that another district lacks the proper educational facilities as well as school.

## Max number of student within hunderd pass percent
Since, in hundred pass percent data set it is natural that the school having highest number of student is the school scoring the highest pass rate. As well as, since total no of student is not same in every school so we can't compare the grade

## General summary of fail result {.tabset .tabset-fade}
As we can see, the school having fail percentage also able to secure distintion in SLC exam. So, this section will summarize the total no of student on basics of grade having zero distinction with fail percentage and vice versa.

Since, we are filtering total no of school with zero distinction. So, it is not required to plot distinction while making barchart
![](index_files/figure-html/Stack barchar of student on basics of grade having fail percentage school without any distinction-1.png)<!-- -->

# Maximum number of passed student within fail percent 
Even in fail percent, we can filter the school having highest number of pass student. Like previous, since total no of student is not same in every school so we can't compare grade. The table below, summarize the information with name of school having maxium pass student.

## Conclusion
Furthermore, we can also calculate among 100% pass student 
which shool have the highest distinction, first division, second division, third division, fail and maximum no of student also

we can decide which school stand on top on basics of this attribute within district

we can also filter top 5 school subject wise highest

filtering data on basics of highest pass percentage and lowest pass percentage

assuming that some of the school have equal number of student
